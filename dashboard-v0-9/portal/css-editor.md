With the portal, all the templates for emails and the look and feel of the web pages is completely template-able and customisable by the admin. However, in some cases (e.g. on a per-organisation portal basis), individual users will want to customise their portals. In order to do so, we have added the ability override the CSS of the page and emails that are sent out as part of the main application. 

Adding new CSS to the fields in this screen will inject the CSS into the various templates at runtime.
