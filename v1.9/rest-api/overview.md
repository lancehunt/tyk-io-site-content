The Tyk REST API is the primary means for integrating your application with the Tyk API Gateway server. In order to use the 
REST API, you'll need to set the `secret` parameter in your `tyk.conf` file.

The shared secret you set should then be sent along as a header with each REST API Request in order for it to be successful:

    x-tyk-authorization: 352d20ee67be67f6340b4c0605b044bc4

the request should be secured with TLS/SSL.
